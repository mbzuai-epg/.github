## üî¨ About Us

The Embodied Perception Group explores the intersection of perception, action, and learning in intelligent systems. Our work focuses on developing algorithms and systems that understand and interact with the world in a grounded, perceptually-informed manner. We aim to bridge the gap between visual understanding and real-world action by designing intelligent agents that perceive, reason, and learn through interaction.
