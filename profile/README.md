# Embodied Perception Group

Welcome to the **Embodied Perception Group** at the **Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**. We are an interdisciplinary research group dedicated to advancing the frontiers of **Computer Vision**, **Robotics**, and **Artificial Intelligence** through the lens of perception and embodied intelligence.

## 🔬 About Us

The Embodied Perception Group explores the intersection of perception, action, and learning in intelligent systems. Our work focuses on developing algorithms and systems that understand and interact with the world in a grounded, perceptually-informed manner. We aim to bridge the gap between visual understanding and real-world action by designing intelligent agents that perceive, reason, and learn through interaction.

## 🧠 Research Areas

* **Computer Vision**
  Deep learning-based visual recognition, object detection, segmentation, 3D scene understanding, multimodal perception, and large-scale visual learning.

* **Robotics**
  Visual navigation, autonomous exploration, manipulation, simulation-to-reality transfer, and sensorimotor learning for embodied agents.

* **Artificial Intelligence**
  Foundation models, reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and the integration of perception with planning and decision-making.

## 📁 Projects

We work on a range of foundational and applied research projects. Some of our current themes include:

* Learning from embodied interaction in simulation and real environments
* Robotic perception and manipulation for real-world tasks
* Scalable visual understanding via foundation models
* Visual navigation with spatial reasoning and memory
* Multisensory learning and 3D scene comprehension
